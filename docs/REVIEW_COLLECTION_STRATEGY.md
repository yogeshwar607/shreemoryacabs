## Review Collection Goals

### 90-Day Targets
- **Total Reviews:** 50+ reviews
- **Average Rating:** 4.8+ stars
- **5-Star Reviews:** 85%+ (42+ out of 50)
- **4-Star Reviews:** 10-15% (5-7 out of 50)
- **Response Rate:** 100% (respond to every review)
- **Response Time:** Within 24 hours for positive, within 4 hours for negative

### Why Reviews Matter
- **Local SEO:** Google prioritizes businesses with more reviews
- **Trust Building:** 93% of customers read reviews before booking
- **Competitive Advantage:** GrEL Cabs likely has 20-30 reviews - we need to exceed this
- **Conversion Rate:** Businesses with 50+ reviews have 2-3x higher conversion
- **Featured Snippets:** Rich review snippets appear in search results

---

## When to Request Reviews

### ✅ BEST Times to Ask (High Success Rate)

1. **Immediately After Excellent Service**
   - Passenger compliments during ride
   - Smooth, on-time pickup
   - Professional driver behavior
   - Comfortable journey with no issues
   - **Success Rate:** 60-70%

2. **After First-Time Customer's Trip**
   - New customers are excited about the experience
   - Especially if they switched from competitor (GrEL, Ola, Uber)
   - **Success Rate:** 50-60%

3. **After Corporate/Repeat Customer Completes Multiple Trips**
   - Ask after 5th trip: "You've traveled with us 5 times now..."
   - **Success Rate:** 40-50%

4. **After Long-Distance/Special Trips**
   - Outstation trips (Shirdi, Lonavala, Mahabaleshwar)
   - Wedding/event transportation
   - Airport transfers with flight tracking
   - **Success Rate:** 55-65%

### ❌ AVOID Asking (Low Success Rate / Damage Risk)

1. **After Service Issues**
   - Delayed pickup
   - Route confusion
   - Vehicle issues
   - Driver behavior complaints
   - **Result:** Risk of negative review

2. **During Busy Hours**
   - Passenger in rush for flight/meeting
   - Multiple bookings waiting
   - **Result:** Ignored request

3. **Too Soon After Trip**
   - Wait at least 5-10 minutes after drop-off
   - Let passenger settle in before asking
   - **Result:** Lower response rate

4. **After Complaint or Issue Resolution**
   - Even if resolved well, wait 1 week
   - Then request review mentioning resolution
   - **Result:** Potentially mixed review

If LOW → Do NOT request review (focus on resolving issue)
    ↓
Track in Review Request Tracker (Google Sheet)
    ↓
