- ❌ No blog or content marketing
- ❌ Poor URL structure for SEO (all content on homepage)
- ✅ **Your Advantage:** Multi-page site with dedicated route pages, 6+ blogs, proper URL structure

#### 2. **Zero Content Marketing**
- ❌ No blog posts
- ❌ No educational content
- ❌ No comparison content
- ❌ No money-saving guides
- ❌ No local area guides

- ❌ Users must click through to booking forms to see rates
- ❌ No price comparison or value proposition
- ✅ **Your Advantage:** Bold ₹3,700 pricing displayed everywhere, price comparison content

#### 4. **Diesel/Petrol Fleet (Not Eco-Friendly)**

- ❌ Limited Google Business Profile optimization (likely)
- ✅ **Your Advantage:** 6 location pages already, can create 20+ more

#### 8. **No Schema Markup Optimization**
- ❌ Basic website, likely minimal schema implementation
- ❌ No FAQ schema, HowTo schema, or rich snippets targeting
