📊 Case Study: How Priya Saves 8 Hours/Month with Shree Morya Cabs

Meet Priya, Senior Manager at a Bengaluru-based IT firm:
• Lives: Wakad, Pune
• Office: Bengaluru (every Tuesday-Thursday)
• Uses: NMIA for Bengaluru commute

Her Journey Before Shree Morya Cabs:
🚗 Drive to Pune Airport (30 min)
🅿️ Parking hassles (₹200/day, often full)
✈️ Limited flight options (3 daily)
⏰ Total weekly commute prep: 2+ hours

Her Journey Now with Shree Morya Cabs + NMIA:
📱 WhatsApp booking (30 seconds)
🚗 Pickup from home (zero parking cost)
⏱️ Work during 2-hour ride (productive time)
✈️ 7 flight options (flexibility)
💰 ₹3,700 cab vs ₹200 parking + ₹500 fuel
⏰ Total weekly commute prep: 30 seconds

Monthly Savings & Benefits:
✅ Time saved: 8 hours/month (reclaimed as work/rest time)
✅ Money saved: ₹1,200/month (parking + fuel + wear-and-tear)
✅ Stress reduced: No parking search, flight delays tracked
✅ Productivity boost: 8 hours of work done during rides
✅ ESG contribution: Zero-emission electric travel

Priya's Quote:
"I used to dread Monday night packing and Tuesday 5 AM driving. Now I just WhatsApp Shree Morya Cabs, sleep in the cab, and wake up at NMIA refreshed. My team jokes that I'm more productive during my Pune-NMIA ride than they are in office!"

Cost-Benefit Analysis (Monthly):
• 4 roundtrips: 8 cab rides × ₹3,700 = ₹29,600
• Alternative (own car): Fuel ₹4,000 + Parking ₹1,600 + Toll ₹2,400 = ₹8,000 (but 16 hours of driving stress)
• Value of 8 reclaimed hours: Priceless
