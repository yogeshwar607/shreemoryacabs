          Pune to Mumbai Electric Cab Service - Our Specialty
        </h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-muted-foreground space-y-4">
          <p>
            The <strong>Pune to Mumbai route</strong> is our most popular service, with hundreds of satisfied customers choosing our electric cabs for this 148-kilometer journey every week. We offer comfortable, zero-emission travel on the scenic Mumbai-Pune Expressway starting at just ₹2,700 for the Citroen eC3, ₹3,700 for the Kia Carens EV, and ₹4,200 for the premium BYD eMax 7.
          </p>

            Our <strong>Pune Mumbai electric cab service</strong> includes flexible pickup from any location in Pune (Hinjewadi, Wakad, Kothrud, Hadapsar, Viman Nagar, Baner, Aundh) with drop-off anywhere in Mumbai (Andheri, Bandra, Powai, Thane, Navi Mumbai). We also provide dedicated <strong>Mumbai to Pune cab service</strong> for return journeys and one-way trips. Book both legs of your journey together and save 10% with our round-trip packages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why choose our electric cabs for Pune-Mumbai travel? Unlike traditional diesel or petrol cabs, our electric vehicles offer silent, smooth rides with no engine noise or vibrations. The expressway journey typically takes 2.5 to 3 hours, and our vehicles have more than enough battery range to complete the trip without any charging stops. Plus, you'll be contributing to a cleaner environment - each Pune-Mumbai trip in our electric cab saves approximately 15-20 kg of CO₂ emissions compared to conventional vehicles.

          Why Choose Electric Cabs Over Traditional Taxis?
        </h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-muted-foreground space-y-4">
          <p>
            Electric vehicles represent the future of transportation, and choosing an electric cab offers numerous advantages over traditional petrol or diesel taxis. Here's why thousands of travelers across Maharashtra are switching to our electric cab service:
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">Environmental Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            Every journey in our electric cabs produces <strong>zero tailpipe emissions</strong>, contributing to cleaner air in our cities. A typical Pune to Mumbai trip saves 15-20 kg of CO₂ emissions. By choosing GreenEVCabs, you're actively participating in reducing air pollution and fighting climate change. Maharashtra's electricity grid increasingly uses renewable energy, making our electric cabs even more sustainable.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Superior Comfort & Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Electric vehicles offer a fundamentally better travel experience. Our electric cabs feature <strong>silent operation</strong> with no engine noise, allowing you to work, talk, or relax in peace. The instant torque from electric motors provides smooth, responsive acceleration without jerky gear changes. There are no engine vibrations, creating a more comfortable ride especially on long journeys like Pune-Mumbai. Advanced features like climate control, panoramic sunroofs, and premium interiors in our Kia Carens EV and BYD E-MAX 7 make every trip enjoyable.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Advanced Safety Features</h3>
          <p>
            Our electric fleet comes equipped with cutting-edge safety technology. <strong>ADAS Level 2 (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)</strong> includes features like adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking. Additional safety features include 360-degree cameras for safer maneuvering, multiple airbags throughout the vehicle, electronic stability control, ABS with EBD, and reinforced battery protection. Electric vehicles also have a lower center of gravity, making them more stable and reducing rollover risk.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Competitive Pricing & Value</h3>
          <p>
            Despite offering premium electric vehicles, our pricing remains competitive. Starting at just ₹18 per kilometer for the Kia Carens EV and ₹22 per kilometer for the BYD E-MAX 7, we offer excellent value. Our transparent pricing includes driver charges, tolls on major routes, and parking. There are no hidden costs, no surge pricing, and no fluctuating fuel surcharges. Corporate clients and regular users can access additional discounts through our monthly packages.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Reliability & Range</h3>
          <p>
            Modern electric vehicles have eliminated "range anxiety." Our Kia Carens EV offers 400+ km range while the BYD E-MAX 7 provides 530+ km on a single charge - more than sufficient for all popular routes including Pune-Mumbai (148 km), Pune-Shirdi (185 km), and Pune-Nashik (210 km). We ensure all vehicles are fully charged before every trip and have access to fast-charging networks across Maharashtra for extended journeys. DC fast charging can replenish 10-80% battery in just 40-45 minutes if needed.
