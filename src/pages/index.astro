    question: "How much does Pune to Mumbai cab cost?",
    answer: "GreenEVCabs charges ₹3,700 all-inclusive for Pune to Mumbai in a luxury 7-seater electric SUV (Kia Carens EV). This includes tolls, driver allowance, and parking - no hidden charges. We're ₹500 cheaper than other electric cab services and ₹1,300 cheaper than diesel cabs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is GreenEVCabs cheaper than GrEL Cabs?",
    answer: "Yes, GreenEVCabs is ₹500 cheaper than GrEL Cabs for Pune-Mumbai routes. We charge ₹3,700 all-inclusive while GrEL charges ₹4,200+. Both use similar electric vehicles (Kia Carens EV, BYD eMax 7), but we offer direct booking without middleman commissions, saving you money.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you charge surge pricing?",
    answer: "No, GreenEVCabs has zero surge pricing. We charge the same ₹3,700 rate during peak hours, rain, festivals, or any time of day. Unlike app-based services that charge 1.5x-3x surge, our prices are fixed and transparent 24/7.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any hidden charges or extra costs?",
    answer: "No hidden charges. Our ₹3,700 rate for Pune-Mumbai is all-inclusive covering base fare, tolls (₹430), driver allowance (₹500), and parking (₹70). You pay exactly ₹3,700 - nothing more at the end of your trip.",
  },
  {
    question: "What type of electric vehicles do you use?",
    answer: "We operate luxury 7-seater electric SUVs: Kia Carens EV and BYD eMax 7. Both are spacious 7-seater vehicles with ample legroom, AC, charging ports, and comfortable seating for families or groups. All vehicles are well-maintained and less than 2 years old.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are electric cabs reliable for Pune-Mumbai long distance?",
    answer: "Yes, absolutely. Our Kia Carens EV and BYD eMax 7 have 400+ km range on full charge - more than enough for 150 km Pune-Mumbai trip. We monitor battery levels and vehicle health continuously. In 50,000+ trips, we've maintained 99.8% on-time completion rate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to pay advance or booking charges?",
    answer: "No advance payment required. You pay the full ₹3,700 only after your trip completes. We also offer free cancellation up to 2 hours before pickup time - no cancellation charges.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I book GreenEVCabs?",
    answer: "Book instantly via WhatsApp at +91 74982 64215 or call directly. Just share your pickup location, date, time, and destination. You'll get instant confirmation with driver details 30 minutes before pickup. Available 24/7.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are your drivers professional and experienced?",
    answer: "Yes, all our drivers are professionally trained with 5+ years of experience on Pune-Mumbai routes. They are verified, background-checked, and trained in customer service and safety protocols. Average driver rating: 4.8/5 stars.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I travel from Mumbai to Pune at the same rate?",
    answer: "Yes, ₹3,700 applies for both directions - Pune to Mumbai and Mumbai to Pune. We also provide airport pickups from Mumbai Airport, Navi Mumbai Airport, and Pune Airport at the same all-inclusive rate with 30 minutes free waiting time.",

          Why Choose Electric Cabs Over Traditional Taxis?
        </h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none text-muted-foreground space-y-4">
          <p>
            Electric vehicles represent the future of transportation, and choosing an electric cab offers numerous advantages over traditional petrol or diesel taxis. Here's why thousands of travelers across Maharashtra are switching to our electric cab service:
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">Environmental Benefits</h3>
          <p>
            Every journey in our electric cabs produces <strong>zero tailpipe emissions</strong>, contributing to cleaner air in our cities. A typical Pune to Mumbai trip saves 15-20 kg of CO₂ emissions. By choosing GreenEVCabs, you're actively participating in reducing air pollution and fighting climate change. Maharashtra's electricity grid increasingly uses renewable energy, making our electric cabs even more sustainable.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Superior Comfort & Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Electric vehicles offer a fundamentally better travel experience. Our electric cabs feature <strong>silent operation</strong> with no engine noise, allowing you to work, talk, or relax in peace. The instant torque from electric motors provides smooth, responsive acceleration without jerky gear changes. There are no engine vibrations, creating a more comfortable ride especially on long journeys like Pune-Mumbai. Advanced features like climate control, panoramic sunroofs, and premium interiors in our Kia Carens EV and BYD E-MAX 7 make every trip enjoyable.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Advanced Safety Features</h3>
          <p>
            Our electric fleet comes equipped with cutting-edge safety technology. <strong>ADAS Level 2 (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems)</strong> includes features like adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking. Additional safety features include 360-degree cameras for safer maneuvering, multiple airbags throughout the vehicle, electronic stability control, ABS with EBD, and reinforced battery protection. Electric vehicles also have a lower center of gravity, making them more stable and reducing rollover risk.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Competitive Pricing & Value</h3>
          <p>
            Despite offering premium electric vehicles, our pricing remains competitive. Starting at just ₹18 per kilometer for the Kia Carens EV and ₹22 per kilometer for the BYD E-MAX 7, we offer excellent value. Our transparent pricing includes driver charges, tolls on major routes, and parking. There are no hidden costs, no surge pricing, and no fluctuating fuel surcharges. Corporate clients and regular users can access additional discounts through our monthly packages.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-6">Reliability & Range</h3>
          <p>
            Modern electric vehicles have eliminated "range anxiety." Our Kia Carens EV offers 400+ km range while the BYD E-MAX 7 provides 530+ km on a single charge - more than sufficient for all popular routes including Pune-Mumbai (148 km), Pune-Shirdi (185 km), and Pune-Nashik (210 km).
