    questions: [
      {
        question: "How do electric cabs help reduce carbon emissions?",
        answer: "Electric cabs produce zero tailpipe emissions, making them completely eco-friendly.

Over a year, if you use our electric cab service regularly, you can personally save several tons of CO2 emissions. Maharashtra's electricity grid increasingly uses renewable energy, making our electric cabs even more sustainable. Choose Shree Morya Cabs for guilt-free, environmentally responsible travel."

Our advanced battery management systems and route planning ensure you never experience range issues. The charging is seamless and doesn't affect your travel time."
      },
      {
        question: "Are electric cabs more expensive to maintain?",
        answer: "Actually, electric vehicles have lower maintenance costs than traditional vehicles, and these savings help us offer competitive prices. EVs have fewer moving parts (no engine oil changes, no transmission repairs, no exhaust systems), regenerative braking reduces brake wear, battery warranties cover major components, and overall mechanical reliability is higher. While the vehicles are premium, the reduced maintenance and zero fuel costs allow us to price our services competitively while offering superior comfort."
