    category: "Electric Vehicles & Fleet",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "What electric vehicles are in your fleet?",
        answer: "Our premium 100% electric fleet features the Kia Carens EV and BYD E-MAX 7. The Kia Carens EV offers spacious 6-7 seater capacity with a range of 400+ km, perfect for families and groups.

Both vehicles ensure zero emissions and maximum comfort."
      },
      {
        question: "How far can electric cabs travel on a single charge?",
        answer: "Our electric cabs have impressive ranges that eliminate range anxiety. The Kia Carens EV offers 400+ km on a single charge, while the BYD E-MAX 7 provides an extended 530+ km range. This is more than sufficient for popular routes like Pune-Mumbai (148 km), Pune-Shirdi (185 km), and Pune-Nashik (210 km) with plenty of charge remaining. We also have access to fast-charging networks across Maharashtra for longer journeys."
      },
      {
        question: "What if the electric cab runs out of charge during my trip?",
        answer: "This is extremely rare as we carefully plan routes and ensure adequate charge before every trip. Our electric vehicles have much longer ranges (400-530 km) than typical intercity trips require. However, in the unlikely event of low charge, we have partnerships with charging networks along major routes. DC fast charging can replenish 10-80% battery in just 40-45 minutes. We monitor battery levels throughout your journey to ensure a smooth, worry-free experience."
      },
      {
        question: "Are electric cabs safe compared to regular cabs?",
        answer: "Electric cabs are actually safer than traditional vehicles. Our Kia Carens EV and BYD E-MAX 7 come with advanced safety features including ADAS Level 2, multiple airbags, ABS with EBD, electronic stability control, 360-degree cameras, and reinforced battery protection. Electric vehicles have a lower center of gravity making them more stable, and our drivers are specially trained in EV operation. All vehicles undergo regular safety inspections and maintenance."
      },
      {
        question: "How comfortable is travel in electric vehicles?",
        answer: "Electric cabs offer superior comfort compared to traditional vehicles.

Our BYD E-MAX 7 features luxury leather seats with ventilation, dual-zone climate control, and premium sound system for the ultimate travel experience."

    category: "Environmental & Technology",
    questions: [
      {
        question: "How do electric cabs help reduce carbon emissions?",
        answer: "Electric cabs produce zero tailpipe emissions, making them completely eco-friendly. A typical 150 km trip (like Pune-Mumbai) in our electric cab saves approximately 15-20 kg of CO2 compared to diesel vehicles. Over a year, if you use our electric cab service regularly, you can personally save several tons of CO2 emissions. Maharashtra's electricity grid increasingly uses renewable energy, making our electric cabs even more sustainable. Choose GreenEVCabs for guilt-free, environmentally responsible travel."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the benefits of choosing electric cabs over regular cabs?",
        answer: "Electric cabs offer multiple advantages: Environmental benefits with zero emissions and lower carbon footprint; Cost benefits with competitive pricing despite premium vehicles; Comfort benefits including silent operation, smooth acceleration, no vibrations, and better air quality inside the cabin; Technology benefits with advanced features like ADAS, 360° cameras, and connectivity; and Social responsibility showing your commitment to sustainable transportation. You get premium service while contributing to a cleaner Maharashtra."
      },
      {
        question: "How are electric vehicles charged for cab service?",
        answer: "Our electric vehicles are charged using a combination of home/depot charging and public fast-charging networks. Each vehicle is fully charged before your trip. We use: DC fast chargers (10-80% in 40-45 minutes) at strategic locations, overnight AC charging at our depots for full battery, and partnerships with charging networks along major routes like Mumbai-Pune Expressway. Our advanced battery management systems and route planning ensure you never experience range issues. The charging is seamless and doesn't affect your travel time."
      },
      {
        question: "Are electric cabs more expensive to maintain?",
        answer: "Actually, electric vehicles have lower maintenance costs than traditional vehicles, and these savings help us offer competitive prices. EVs have fewer moving parts (no engine oil changes, no transmission repairs, no exhaust systems), regenerative braking reduces brake wear, battery warranties cover major components, and overall mechanical reliability is higher. While the vehicles are premium, the reduced maintenance and zero fuel costs allow us to price our services competitively while offering superior comfort."
