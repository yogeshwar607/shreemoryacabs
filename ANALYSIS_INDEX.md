---

## IMPORTANT FINDINGS

### Your Competitive Advantages
1. **Transparent Pricing** - Only operator showing prices (₹3,700 clearly)
2. **Route Specialization** - Pune-Mumbai expert (GrEL is city-first)
3. **7-Seater Option** - Only EV operator with 7-seater
4. **Vehicle Clarity** - Specific models with specs
5. **Mid-Market Positioning** - Premium features, accessible price

### Competitor Weaknesses to Exploit
- **GrEL:** Hidden pricing, new to route, limited content
- **KK Travels:** No EV, outdated brand, no digital strategy

- This is the #1 priority focus area

### Market Window
